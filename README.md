# Portfolio website

As a part of [Codecademy Full-stack Engineer Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path), I created a small portfolio [website](https://pbuslaev.github.io/). It includes the main page with a brief description of the projects I have worked on, and a page with contact information.
